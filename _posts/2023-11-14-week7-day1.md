## Announcement

- HW5, due Fri 11/17 @ 11:59pm. 

## Q&A

- Why is the volume of a parallelepiped the determinant of the matrix whose columns are the vectors defining the parallelepiped? Let $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{Q} \mathbf{R}$ be the QR factorization. Then the volume of the parallelepiped defined by the columns of $\mathbf{A}$ is the product of diagonal entries of $\mathbf{R}$.

## Today

- Matrix determinant.

- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
